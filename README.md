Airline Management System is a Java-based project
designed to streamline flight management, user bookings,
and payments. It includes key modules like Admin Panel
(for managing flights and viewing users/bookings),
User Panel (for flight search, booking, and ticket 
management), and a Payment System (to handle payments
and update booking records). The project uses JavaFX 
for the GUI, MySQL for the database, and follows a 
structured backend-first approach using Java and the 
DAO pattern. Developed in IntelliJ IDEA with Maven for
dependency management, it highlights integration of 
technologies like Java, MySQL, and JavaFX to solve 
real-world challenges efficiently.
